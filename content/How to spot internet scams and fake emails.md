Recently I decided to hold a short(ish) staff training session on how to spot internet / email scams. The catalyst behind this, was primarily due to the sheer amount of helpdesk queries being received, pertaining to whether a particular website or email was genuine etc.

Whilst as a department, we have so far successfully evaded any serious disaster resulting from a virus-riddled email etc (e.g. Ransomware) - it was evident that a basic lecture on the subject, with some fundamental tips & tricks, wouldn't go amiss.

We decided to record the session, enabling a wider audience to benefit from the presentation.

Below is the aforementioned lecture (30 mins).
