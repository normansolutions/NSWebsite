Recently, a very good friend of mine _(_[_@richieclarkie_](https://twitter.com/richieclarkie)_)_ decided to return to the IT industry after a 15 year absence.

> _Clearly a 15 year hiatus, is significant in any industry, but especially pertaining to IT, it is arguably exceptional._

Whilst there will always be some _core fundamentals_ to the IT industry, in truth, he is in many ways, starting over.  However, I'm happy to report, he is extremely energised and keen to get back into a more **'operations'** driving seat.

_Knowing I have a near obsessive interest in listening to technical podcasts, he asked me for some suggestions; hence this blog post._

## The New Age Of Education

We live in a time where there is a wealth of educational information, freely available online. Whether using one of the more formal teaching platforms like [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) or [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), or just _tuning_ into one of the many excellent and often extremely professional podcasts available, these resources can at the very least, be a huge compliment to formal education - some could even argue a replacement!

Whatever your opinion, it’s difficult to disagree with the fact that _some_ of these resources, are unbelievably useful for keeping up to speed with this frantically evolving world, we call ‘**IT’**.

## Podcatcher Of Choice

There are many systems available for listening to podcasts, but my current personal _‘podcatcher of choice’_ is the excellent [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts) app.

I often have the podcast playback **speeded** up 1.3 times – _the app is clever_ _enough to not raise the pitch, yet enables me to get through shows a little quicker._

Also, a lot of podcasts have adverts - pressing the forward button on the Pocket Casts app, quickly advances the podcast by 30 seconds – very handy!

## Podcast List

Below is a list of the more 'technical' podcasts that I listen to on a regular basis _(at the time of writing),_ along with a brief description and personal opinion.

- [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) – General technical content, but primarily web development - this is my top choice - I haven't missed an episode in about 4 years!
- [DotNet Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) - General technical content, but primarily web development - this is probably my next favourite - I dip into these - listen to a couple a week.
- [RunAs Radio](http://www.runasradio.com/) – General operations & sys admin content - I dip into these - probably listen to one every few weeks.
- [Shoptalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/) - All front end web development (CSS, JavaScript etc) - I listen to this each week.
- [Coding Blocks](http://www.codingblocks.net/) - All development _(really good, but quite advanced)_ - I listen to this as and when they release.
- [BBC Click](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/digitalp) - General technical content - I dip into this if the title looks interesting.
- [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) – General coding content - I listen to this as and when they release.
- [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/) - All programming content - I listen to this occasionally – in truth, it can be quite _dry_, but often contains a few gems!
- [JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) – JavaScript panel discussion - I listen to this every week.
- [Adventures in Angular](http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular) - AngularJS _(JavaScript)_ panel discussion - I listen to this every week.

_There are numerous other podcasts that I sample on occasion, ranging from the_ [_Defensive Security_](http://www.defensivesecurity.org/) _podcast to the_ [_CodeNewbie_](http://www.codenewbie.org/) _podcast, but I listen to these less frequently._
