One of my favourite blog posts is “[I'm a phony. Are you?](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx)” by Scott Hanselman.  I was on holiday in France when I read this post, and it gave me a wonderful sense of relief - I highly encourage you to read it.

Monsieur Hanselman has in many ways, been like an unofficial virtual mentor for myself; I regularly listen to the [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) podcast, and again, highly recommend it.

The fact is, that despite having been “fiddling” with computer programming since I was 12 years old _(starting on a_ [_Sharp MZ-80K_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ#MZ-80K_group) _- which my father still owns!) -_ I never really fitted the conventional stereotype of a [maths driven computer geek](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet) - in the late 80’s and 90’s this didn’t really encourage “one” to embrace IT with real confidence!

> In truth, I fit the classic “Jack of all trades” rather than a “Master of one”.

I have a serious thirst for knowledge - true, not _necessarily_ an ability to master it, but definitely to acquire it.  Over time, I have realised that this benefits me on several levels; whether I am just being the “family Google” _(for school homework assistance),_ or engaging in conversation with someone, be it about [Equal Temperament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament), [Thomas Hardy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy), [Einstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), [The Jam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jam), [Spiritual Meditation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Letters-Extreme-Pilgrim-Reflections-Life/dp/1846041333), [the Battle of Hastings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings) or the [Offside Rule](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)>) *(ok…maybe not the offside rule - that’s pushing it),* but you get the idea, a variety of knowledge comes with benefits.

The _“Jack of all”_ also applies to my musical abilities; whilst I can play the piano, guitar, bass, vocals and enjoy song-writing to a reasonable level, I am definitely no [Mozart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart) or [Dylan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan).

However, a side benefit of being “_Jack_” is that it has enabled me to experience a vast array of different musical experiences, ranging from performances at the world famous [Marquee Club](http://www.themarqueeclub.net/) through to working as a semi-professional touring musician, knocking up several hundred gigs over the past 25 years.

## Ok – you didn’t feel like a computer genius, your point being?

My point, is that because I never felt I was a “_real_” computer [genius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)_,_ I initially shied away from taking any huge jump of confidence into the IT industry, for fear of ritual humiliation.  To be fair, I made further headway into the music industry, before eventually realising that I needed to eat – _**financial success in music is hard!**_

With hindsight, I realised that by gaining experience working in several “other” industries _(legal, retail etc),_ enjoying the opposite side of the IT fence for a few years - in short, being a “real” end user - provided me with a surprising empathy and ability to assist customers, especially in my early days of IT support; I understood where they were coming from - something that I do occasionally see lacking in a lot of technicians, who have never worked _outside_ of IT.

## [The times, they are a-changin!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin')

With the benefit of age _(oh yes, there are some, trust me!),_ being a father, having an amazingly inspiring and encouraging wife, combined with a sheer “_what the heck_” attitude, I now embrace the knowledge and experience that I **know I have**.  I feel confident to help others, develop products and to engage in technical debate _(on differing levels),_ where required; but crucially, I am also very happy to acknowledge when I _don’t_ know something - _that’s a lot harder and indeed rarer, than you think!_

So, to summarise; I eventually re-joined the IT world many moons ago, when it was still to some extent, a rather arrogant industry _(pre_ [_dot com bubble_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)_) -_ where a technical employee with very little _true_ knowledge and experience, could secure a lucrative position, just by knowing a little more than the person who employed them.  A time where “arrogance” and “hostility” were almost required credentials!

Luckily, an industry that I love, is becoming much more responsible, respectable, accepting and less patronising.  It does have a long way to go _(I still meet those “con-men” who love to try and “blind with science” -  and it’s always nice to challenge them)._ It also needs to embrace and encourage both genders equally *(there are still far too few women working in IT) -* but it has made serious progress [IMHO](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/IMHO).

So, to the title of the post - yes, possibly at times, you may indeed not feel good enough, and possibly, at times, you don’t want to hear that - **but** be under no illusion - this is a great industry that encourages more than ever, **your** input, **your** opinion and **your** knowledge, as well as continuing to _offer_ you, it’s output, opinion and knowledge _(it never stops turning, and you never stop learning – whatever your age)._

**Simply put - I would _probably_ not be working in, and enjoying the industry I love, if it were the same “beast” that it was in the 80’s and 90’s – _so bring on 2014!_**
