Recently, I had the privileged of being asked to give a ‘_show and tell’_ style presentation, at the Firefly Developer’s Day, held at [Radley College](http://www.radley.org.uk/Home.aspx).

In truth, I received this invitation with a mixture of pride and anxiety – visions springing to mind of the [Michael Bay _‘meltdown_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqRyzTvNKE)_’_ during his presentation at CES 2014!

Don’t get me wrong, I love debates of all natures _(just ask my colleagues & family!)_ and certainly feel confident in my chosen subject area.  Indeed, in a ‘previous life’ my primary role was working as a software trainer.

> _Why heck, I’ve done hundreds of musical gigs over the past 25 years or so (albeit in the comfort of a band environment); but a crowd isn’t completely alien to me._

**However**, it’s always slightly _scary_ when you don’t _truly_ know your audience or the quality of technical support that’s there to back you up!

I have always prided myself on doing the best I can, in whatever I do – I’m not claiming to be a perfectionist by any means, but I like to do a good job.

Although, in truth this was a relatively _small_ gathering of technically minded folk, I still wanted to give it my best shot.  As such, I took advice from several people, that had more experience of public speaking than me _(particular thanks to Chris Sykes – the Drama Teacher at St Mary’s School, Shaftesbury)._

## So, a plan of action was established _(...sort of)_

- Presentation must have **credibility** - _I have witnessed too many IT presentations in the past, which attempt to ‘blind with science’ in order to mask a clear lack of subject knowledge!_
- Must be passionate and engaging _(well, as much as you can be, in such circumstances)._
- Allow for technical fall-back if things go wrong _expect_ things to go wrong !.
- Have a back-up strategy for stage nerves.
- Rehearse, rehearse and then rehearse again.
- Test, test and then test again.
- Did I say ‘_test’_?
- Did I say _‘rehearse’_?
- Oh yes, and _breathe_!
- Post presentation review.

## Overkill?

Some may say this is a little overkill for a small presentation, but I would disagree.

Indeed, I even went so far as to pre-record screen cast video’s of all the demos used in the presentation, just in case of internet failure _(as funny enough, that happens occasionally)._

For a bit of sparkle, I also took the opportunity to use the browser based presentation framework [revealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) in an attempt to break away from **death by PowerPoint**.  Ironically, I received more comments about this, than anything else _(I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing)._

I rehearsed the talk several times, and also maintained a good old fashioned ‘paper’ crib sheet – _yes you read that correctly, paper!_

## Summary and Video!

This may just be a rambling about a ‘small town’ IT presentation, but I am glad to report that the event went rather well, as did the Firefly Developer’s Day in general.

I certainly didn’t _‘die on stage’ - technically or emotionally_ _(which is always a bonus),_ and I hope a few nuggets of information were successfully dispensed.

Clearly, there is always room for improvement, which I shall endeavour to make.

Unfortunately, the quality of the video footage from the presentation is rather poor, but Firefly were kind enough to provide me with a copy, for post presentation critique!

As such, to complete the blog post, I have included this below _(warts and all)_ along with a link to the revealJS presentation.

_(Sincere thanks to Firefly for giving me the stage; to Radley College ICT department, who provided excellent and seamless support, and to my fellow attendees of the Firefly Developer’s Day, who were very kind in their reception)_
