Frankly, I love IT, and web development in particular.  I also happen to be exceptionally fortunate to work as an ICT Systems Manager, for a wonderful employer (St Mary's Shaftesbury) with a great boss _([@pearcejim](https://twitter.com/pearcejim))_ alongside excellent, appreciative colleagues – the surrounding environment, is also quite heavenly – trust me, it beats working on an industrial estate, just take a look!

Ok, creep points out of the way – this is my angle.

I often work on challenging, mainly in-house, non-public facing projects, which is great.  However, this does mean that a lot of the work I do, is not seen in the same way as a conventional web developer, who may be knocking out websites by the month.  When I do have the opportunity to create websites for a public audience, it’s nice, but this can be infrequent.  Therein, lies the problem.

**Web Design/IT - both in terms of technologies and accepted practices & styles evolves at a ridiculously fast pace _(helped by [Moore's Law and all that!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law))_**

It’s quite strange how you can go from feeling really proud of a website that you have created, to a feeling of near ‘embarrassment’ within a pretty darn short period of time.  It’s fine if you are pushing out a new public portfolio every month, however, if not, then it can present a problem!

Being an avid listener of several major IT focussed, discussion podcasts, I noticed there was a consistent message emanating from then all – **talk about what you do**.  Not only could this potentially help others, but could also communicate more effectively to clients and colleagues, exactly what you do, how you approach different problems, and your thinking; much better than just having a pretty list of websites.

So, that’s why I decided to "bin the portfolio and blog instead"!
