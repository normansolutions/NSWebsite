      <description>Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.
Recently, I introduced a frictionless *(logon free) *way of providing secure(ish) access to some very basic web services.
….I can hear all those security experts screaming already!
 Before I proceed any further, please note that this solution must never be seen as a proper security authentication replacement!</description>

      <title>Tracking devices in UniFi WiFi</title>

      <description>Several years ago, we migrated from a Cisco Wi-Fi infrastructure to a UniFi setup.
UniFi (from Ubiquiti Networks) offer a pretty remarkable WiFi solution, especially when it comes down to cost. I shan’t go into the in’s and out’s of UniFi, as apart from anything else, I can’t claim to be an expert in the technology. In many ways, it just works!
 What’s interesting, is the database supporting the UniFi controller is MongoDB (a NoSQL database, that can be queried using JavaScript).</description>
