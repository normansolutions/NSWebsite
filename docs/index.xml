      <description>Recently, we had a situation where an iPad had gone missing. Although it is possible to establish an approximate location of a given device, using UniFi’s controller system, clearly this is only effective whilst the device is connected; the next best option is a singular ‘last seen’ log entry.

      <description>It’s been eight months since my last blog post, having taken on a new job, been on the receiving end of a full-on enterprise ransomware attack (that wasn’t nice!) and quite frankly experiencing one heck of a baptism of fire - I felt it was time do write a quick blog post tip!
In my new role, I haven’t had a lot of time or indeed need, to write many database queries.</description>

      <title>Honeypots to catch prying eyes!</title>

      <description>As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, I regularly listen to numerous technical podcasts. A relatively new edition to my listening collection is the information security podcast Risky Business – it’s great!
On a recent episode, the company thinkst, were discussing a project they have been working on, to do with Honeypots.
 Not only are these Honeypots an extremely funky security layer, they are also free (at the time of posting).</description>

      <title>Secure a webpage without a logon?</title>
      <link>https://outoforderband.co.uk/secure-a-webpage-without-a-logon/</link>

      <description>Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.
Recently, I introduced a frictionless (logon free) way of providing secure(ish) access to some very basic web services.
….I can hear all those security experts screaming already!
 Before I proceed any further, please note that this solution must never be seen as a proper security authentication replacement!</description>

      <title>Tracking devices in UniFi WiFi</title>

      <description>Several years ago, we migrated from a Cisco Wi-Fi infrastructure to a UniFi setup.
UniFi (from Ubiquiti Networks) offer a pretty remarkable WiFi solution, especially when it comes down to cost. I shan’t go into the in’s and out’s of UniFi, as apart from anything else, I can’t claim to be an expert in the technology. In many ways, it just works!
 What’s interesting, is the database supporting the UniFi controller is MongoDB (a NoSQL database, that can be queried using JavaScript).</description>
