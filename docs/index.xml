      <description>Like many people, I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with Power BI over the years but have never really dug deep into the weeds; the same can also be said for the iSAMS REST API.</description>

      <description>Having fully migrated our on-prem Exchange to Exchange Online, there were a few little gotchas along the way that we had to contend with - which was to be expected.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to receive unwanted emails which have managed to work their way through the array of filtering systems in production. Recently our organisation received such an email - a classic phishing email sent to multiple end user accounts.</description>

      <description>To be honest, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure any right-minded individual would agree, downloading videos from YouTube for personal gain is wrong. However, there are occasions when it is arguably reasonable and possibly even legitimate to do such a thing.</description>

      <description>A common issue with supporting a primarily Windows based user body, is that thanks to the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; expectation emboldened by smartphones and tablets, it can be a constant battle to try and encourage end users to restart their computers with some degree of regularity - yes IT friends, you know exactly what I mean!</description>

      <description>It’s been eight months since my last blog post, having taken on a new job, been on the receiving end of a full-on enterprise ransomware attack (that wasn’t nice!) and quite frankly experiencing one heck of a baptism of fire - I felt it was time do write a quick blog post tip!</description>

      <description>Recently I decided to hold a short(ish) staff training session on how to spot internet / email scams.

      <description>As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, I regularly listen to numerous technical podcasts. A relatively new edition to my listening collection is the information security podcast Risky Business – it’s great!</description>

      <description>Recently, we received rather confusing claims from specific users, stating they were receiving certain emails, often days after they had been sent. This behavior was not consistent across the user base.</description>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/secure-a-webpage-without-a-logon/</guid>
      <description>Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.
Recently, I introduced a frictionless (logon free) way of providing secure(ish) access to some very basic web services.</description>

      <description>It recently occurred to me, that whilst my current full-time position is an IT Systems Manager, the majority of my blog posts thus far, have been more web centric – which is great, as I love the web and web technologies!</description>
