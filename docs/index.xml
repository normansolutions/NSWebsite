      <title>PowerBI with Cloudflare</title>
      <link>https://normansolutions.co.uk/powerbi-with-cloudflare/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been working with Power BI to build dashboards. One particular requirement involved pulling in data from Cloudflare to display statistics on blocked traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s API is well-documented, so I won’t delve into that here. If you need guidance on creating a Cloudflare API token with the necessary permissions, I recommend checking this helpful resource: &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/&#34;&gt;Cloudflare API: Create a Token&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PowerShell Logging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of PowerShell scripting, and it’s given me the chance to expand my experience and exposure to best practices. One of the key areas I’ve focused on is logging — something that’s often overlooked but incredibly valuable when troubleshooting or reviewing script performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I last blogged - life has certainly been busy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years I&amp;rsquo;ve somewhat immersed myself in PowerShell. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a PowerShell Guru, my knowledge has substantially grown, thanks in part to splendid collaboration with some exceptional colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK&amp;hellip;.that title was a bit of a mouthful - but it&amp;rsquo;s a little difficult to categorise what is essentially a kind of hack!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I felt it was advisable to start regularly recording my blood pressure results &lt;em&gt;(comes with age I&amp;rsquo;m afraid)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Power Automate with the iSAMS API</title>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/using-power-automate-with-the-isams-api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently being getting deeper into the weeds &lt;em&gt;(so to speak)&lt;/em&gt; with Power Automate.  Whilst this product clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t a fully fledged programming model, it does sit very nicely in that &amp;ldquo;low code&amp;rdquo; methodology, and can be extremely  effective when there is a need to quickly create and perform a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I wrote a console app for accessing the iSAMS API</title>
      <link>https://normansolutions.co.uk/why-i-wrote-a-console-app-for-accessing-the-isams-api/</link>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/why-i-wrote-a-console-app-for-accessing-the-isams-api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me register that I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; prefer writing raw SQL when interrogating iSAMS than using the official iSAMS REST API - there, I&amp;rsquo;ve said it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, I do entirely appreciate the necessity for an official API in order to cater for security, consistency, potential database schema changes &amp;amp; futureproofing etc. As such, the need to embrace the iSAMS API is I feel, something of a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Power BI &#43; iSAMS API</title>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/power-bi-and-isams-api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with Power BI over the years but have never really dug deep into the weeds; the same can also be said for the iSAMS REST API. So recently I thought why not combine these two systems and see what can be achieved?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having fully migrated our on-prem Exchange to Exchange Online, there were a few little gotchas along the way that we had to contend with - which was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to receive unwanted emails which have managed to work their way through the array of filtering systems in production.  Recently our organisation received such an email - a classic phishing email sent to multiple end user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>YouTube downloading using WSL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To be honest, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure any right-minded individual would agree, downloading videos from YouTube for personal gain is &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.  However, there are occasions when it is arguably reasonable and possibly even legitimate to do such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common issue with supporting a primarily Windows based user body, is that thanks to the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; expectation emboldened by smartphones and tablets, it can be a constant battle to try and encourage end users to restart their computers with some degree of regularity - yes IT friends, you know exactly what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/how-to-spot-internet-scams-and-fake-emails/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided to hold a short(ish) staff training session on how to spot internet / email scams. The catalyst behind this, was primarily due to the sheer amount of helpdesk queries being received, pertaining to whether a particular website or email was genuine etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, information security is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt;.  With more and more data being stored and accessed via the internet, we are becoming increasingly reliant on “third parties” to secure our personal data responsibly.  So how is it that we are seeing so many data breaches and poor practices?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned in previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://normansolutions.co.uk/post/welcome-to-podcast-university&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, I regularly listen to numerous technical podcasts.  A relatively new edition to my listening collection is the information security podcast &lt;a href=&#34;http://risky.biz/netcasts/risky-business&#34;&gt;Risky Business&lt;/a&gt; – it’s great!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most users of Office 365 will no doubt be aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Clutter-to-sort-low-priority-messages-in-Outlook-2016-for-Windows-7b50c5db-7704-4e55-8a1b-dfc7bf1eafa0&#34;&gt;Clutter&lt;/a&gt; folder; for the most part this Clutter folder works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not intending to go into the algorithmic processes of how the Clutter folder works, in this blog post - even if I could!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, we received rather confusing claims from specific users, stating they were receiving certain emails, often &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; after they had been sent.  This behavior was not consistent across the user base.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I introduced a frictionless &lt;em&gt;(logon free)&lt;/em&gt; way of providing &lt;em&gt;secure(ish)&lt;/em&gt; access to some very basic web services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key benefit of working with the web &lt;em&gt;(or more specifically http)&lt;/em&gt; is it’s native ability to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html&#34;&gt;cache&lt;/a&gt;.  This can be ‘tuned’ to make websites extremely fast and slick, especially after initial page load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the privileged of being asked to give a ‘&lt;em&gt;show and tell’&lt;/em&gt; style presentation, at the Firefly Developer’s Day, held at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radley.org.uk/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;Radley College&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In truth, I received this invitation with a mixture of pride and anxiety – visions springing to mind of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqRyzTvNKE&#34;&gt;Michael Bay &lt;em&gt;‘meltdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt; during his presentation at CES 2014!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a sad fact that security can all too often be the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html&#34;&gt;poor relative&lt;/a&gt; in software and systems design &lt;em&gt;(please note that this blog post is not intended to address system security per se; the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;OWASP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;website and / or security expert&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.troyhunt.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Troy Hunt’s blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;are good references for that topic).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At St Mary’s we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.furlongsolutions.com/products/schoolbase&#34;&gt;Schoolbase&lt;/a&gt; from Furlong Solutions, for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_systems&#34;&gt;MIS&lt;/a&gt; - we have done so for several years &lt;em&gt;(indeed my understanding is that we were the second or third official school to have the system in production).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Plotting earthquakes on a Firefly VLE page</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many technically minded people, I subscribe to a variety of IT focussed information sources (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&#34;&gt;RSS Feeds&lt;/a&gt;, Newsletters etc); one such newsletter being &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Powertip of the day&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://powershell.com/&#34;&gt;Powershell.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A recent “&lt;a href=&#34;http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/tips/archive/2013/12/31/getting-most-recent-earthquakes.aspx&#34;&gt;Powertip of the day&lt;/a&gt;” demonstrated how it was possible to query an online earthquake activity data resource, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell&#34;&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;.  In truth, I didn’t have too much success with this particular example &lt;em&gt;(the data wasn’t up-to-date),&lt;/em&gt; but crucially, it set me thinking that this could be an excellent resource for a Geography department, especially when using &lt;a href=&#34;http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite blog posts is “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a phony. Are you?&lt;/a&gt;” by Scott Hanselman.  I was on holiday in France when I read this post, and it gave me a wonderful sense of relief - I highly encourage you to read it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt; for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment&#34;&gt;VLE&lt;/a&gt;.  I won’t give you a sales pitch on Firefly, but suffice to say, that after a bit of a journey from &lt;a href=&#34;https://moodle.org/&#34;&gt;Moodle&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint&#34;&gt;SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; we have rested at Firefly – quite simply, at this point in time &lt;em&gt;(history has taught me that things can change!),&lt;/em&gt; this product, the company and their approach to IT, is nothing short of excellent.  I like Firefly; I like the chaps and chapesses at Firefly!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently St Mary’s Shaftesbury had a new website built (&lt;em&gt;I would like to register, that whilst I was actively involved in the project management, I did not design this website&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I love IT, and web development in particular.  I also happen to be exceptionally fortunate to work as an ICT Systems Manager, for a wonderful employer (St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury) with a great boss &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pearcejim&#34;&gt;@pearcejim&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; alongside excellent, appreciative colleagues – the surrounding environment, is also quite heavenly – trust me, it beats working on an industrial estate!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To CMS or not to CMS?</title>
      <link>https://normansolutions.co.uk/to-cms-or-not-to-cms/</link>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/to-cms-or-not-to-cms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, the time has come for a website refresh – it’s something that I like to try and do annually &lt;em&gt;(well, I say annually, what I really mean is that I did it last year).&lt;/em&gt; The question, is do I roll my own, as I have always done, or jump into the CMS world?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
