      <description>One of my favourite blog posts is “I&amp;rsquo;m a phony. Are you?” by Scott Hanselman. I was on holiday in France when I read this post, and it gave me a wonderful sense of relief - I highly encourage you to read it.</description>

      <description>Frankly, I love IT, and web development in particular. I also happen to be exceptionally fortunate to work as an ICT Systems Manager, for a wonderful employer (St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury) with a great boss (@pearcejim) alongside excellent, appreciative colleagues – the surrounding environment, is also quite heavenly – trust me, it beats working on an industrial estate, just take a look!</description>
