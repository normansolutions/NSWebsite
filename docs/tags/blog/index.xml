      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a very good friend of mine &lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/richieclarkie&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@richieclarkie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; decided to return to the IT industry after a 15 year absence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clearly a 15 year hiatus, is significant in any industry, but especially pertaining to IT, it is arguably exceptional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I must confess to have slightly struggled with the title of this blog post, as I didn’t wish to be responsible for encouraging unnecessary complaints and animosity between clients and web designers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite blog posts is “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a phony. Are you?&lt;/a&gt;” by Scott Hanselman.  I was on holiday in France when I read this post, and it gave me a wonderful sense of relief - I highly encourage you to read it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I love IT, and web development in particular.  I also happen to be exceptionally fortunate to work as an ICT Systems Manager, for a wonderful employer (St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury) with a great boss &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pearcejim&#34;&gt;@pearcejim&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; alongside excellent, appreciative colleagues – the surrounding environment, is also quite heavenly – trust me, it beats working on an industrial estate!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To CMS or not to CMS?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, the time has come for a website refresh – it’s something that I like to try and do annually &lt;em&gt;(well, I say annually, what I really mean is that I did it last year).&lt;/em&gt; The question, is do I roll my own, as I have always done, or jump into the CMS world?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
