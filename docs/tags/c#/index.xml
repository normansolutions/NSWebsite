      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me register that I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; prefer writing raw SQL when interrogating iSAMS than using the official iSAMS REST API - there, I&amp;rsquo;ve said it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, I do entirely appreciate the necessity for an official API in order to cater for security, consistency, potential database schema changes &amp;amp; futureproofing etc. As such, the need to embrace the iSAMS API is I feel, something of a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secure a webpage without a logon?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I introduced a frictionless &lt;em&gt;(logon free)&lt;/em&gt; way of providing &lt;em&gt;secure(ish)&lt;/em&gt; access to some very basic web services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cache-busting in C# without querystrings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key benefit of working with the web &lt;em&gt;(or more specifically http)&lt;/em&gt; is it’s native ability to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html&#34;&gt;cache&lt;/a&gt;.  This can be ‘tuned’ to make websites extremely fast and slick, especially after initial page load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At St Mary’s we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.furlongsolutions.com/products/schoolbase&#34;&gt;Schoolbase&lt;/a&gt; from Furlong Solutions, for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_systems&#34;&gt;MIS&lt;/a&gt; - we have done so for several years &lt;em&gt;(indeed my understanding is that we were the second or third official school to have the system in production).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a Firefly VLE online users feature</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt; for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment&#34;&gt;VLE&lt;/a&gt;.  I won’t give you a sales pitch on Firefly, but suffice to say, that after a bit of a journey from &lt;a href=&#34;https://moodle.org/&#34;&gt;Moodle&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint&#34;&gt;SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; we have rested at Firefly – quite simply, at this point in time &lt;em&gt;(history has taught me that things can change!),&lt;/em&gt; this product, the company and their approach to IT, is nothing short of excellent.  I like Firefly; I like the chaps and chapesses at Firefly!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To CMS or not to CMS?</title>
      <link>https://normansolutions.co.uk/to-cms-or-not-to-cms/</link>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/to-cms-or-not-to-cms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, the time has come for a website refresh – it’s something that I like to try and do annually &lt;em&gt;(well, I say annually, what I really mean is that I did it last year).&lt;/em&gt; The question, is do I roll my own, as I have always done, or jump into the CMS world?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
