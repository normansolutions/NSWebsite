      <description>Firstly, let me register that I much prefer writing raw SQL when interrogating iSAMS than using the official iSAMS REST API - there, I&amp;rsquo;ve said it!
However, I do entirely appreciate the necessity for an official API in order to cater for security, consistency, potential database schema changes &amp;amp; futureproofing etc.</description>

      <description>Like many people, I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with Power BI over the years but have never really dug deep into the weeds; the same can also be said for the iSAMS REST API.</description>

      <description>It’s been eight months since my last blog post, having taken on a new job, been on the receiving end of a full-on enterprise ransomware attack (that wasn’t nice!) and quite frankly experiencing one heck of a baptism of fire - I felt it was time do write a quick blog post tip!</description>
