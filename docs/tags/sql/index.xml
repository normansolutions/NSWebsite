      <description>Firstly, let me register that I much prefer writing raw SQL for iSAMS than using the official iSAMS REST API - there, I&amp;rsquo;ve said it!
In fairness this probably aligns with my IT experience, in that I tend to embrace the &amp;ldquo;Swiss Army Knife&amp;rdquo; approach of skills and experiences.</description>

      <description>It’s been eight months since my last blog post, having taken on a new job, been on the receiving end of a full-on enterprise ransomware attack (that wasn’t nice!) and quite frankly experiencing one heck of a baptism of fire - I felt it was time do write a quick blog post tip!</description>
