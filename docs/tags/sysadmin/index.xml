      <description>As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, I regularly listen to numerous technical podcasts. A relatively new edition to my listening collection is the information security podcast Risky Business – it’s great!
On a recent episode, the company thinkst, were discussing a project they have been working on, to do with Honeypots.
 Not only are these Honeypots an extremely funky security layer, they are also free (at the time of posting).</description>
