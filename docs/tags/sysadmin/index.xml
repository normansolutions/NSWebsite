      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I last blogged - life has certainly been busy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years I&amp;rsquo;ve somewhat immersed myself in PowerShell. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a PowerShell Guru, my knowledge has substantially grown, thanks in part to splendid collaboration with some exceptional colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having fully migrated our on-prem Exchange to Exchange Online, there were a few little gotchas along the way that we had to contend with - which was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to receive unwanted emails which have managed to work their way through the array of filtering systems in production.  Recently our organisation received such an email - a classic phishing email sent to multiple end user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Encourage those Windows to restart!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common issue with supporting a primarily Windows based user body, is that thanks to the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; expectation emboldened by smartphones and tablets, it can be a constant battle to try and encourage end users to restart their computers with some degree of regularity - yes IT friends, you know exactly what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Security should be a first class citizen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, information security is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt;.  With more and more data being stored and accessed via the internet, we are becoming increasingly reliant on “third parties” to secure our personal data responsibly.  So how is it that we are seeing so many data breaches and poor practices?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned in previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://normansolutions.co.uk/post/welcome-to-podcast-university&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, I regularly listen to numerous technical podcasts.  A relatively new edition to my listening collection is the information security podcast &lt;a href=&#34;http://risky.biz/netcasts/risky-business&#34;&gt;Risky Business&lt;/a&gt; – it’s great!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most users of Office 365 will no doubt be aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Clutter-to-sort-low-priority-messages-in-Outlook-2016-for-Windows-7b50c5db-7704-4e55-8a1b-dfc7bf1eafa0&#34;&gt;Clutter&lt;/a&gt; folder; for the most part this Clutter folder works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not intending to go into the algorithmic processes of how the Clutter folder works, in this blog post - even if I could!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, we received rather confusing claims from specific users, stating they were receiving certain emails, often &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; after they had been sent.  This behavior was not consistent across the user base.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It recently occurred to me, that whilst my current full-time position is an IT Systems Manager, the majority of my blog posts thus far, have been more web centric – which is great, as I love the web and web technologies!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a very good friend of mine &lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/richieclarkie&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@richieclarkie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; decided to return to the IT industry after a 15 year absence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clearly a 15 year hiatus, is significant in any industry, but especially pertaining to IT, it is arguably exceptional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracking devices in UniFi WiFi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, we migrated from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/UK/index.html#x6CjTZEDlwuM6WO1.97&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; Wi-Fi infrastructure to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubnt.com/enterprise/&#34;&gt;UniFi&lt;/a&gt; setup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UniFi &lt;em&gt;(from Ubiquiti Networks)&lt;/em&gt; offer a pretty remarkable WiFi solution, especially when it comes down to cost.  I shan’t go into the in’s and out’s of UniFi, as apart from anything else, I can’t claim to be an expert in the technology.  In many ways, it just works!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a sad fact that security can all too often be the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html&#34;&gt;poor relative&lt;/a&gt; in software and systems design &lt;em&gt;(please note that this blog post is not intended to address system security per se; the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;OWASP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;website and / or security expert&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.troyhunt.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Troy Hunt’s blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;are good references for that topic).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At St Mary’s we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.furlongsolutions.com/products/schoolbase&#34;&gt;Schoolbase&lt;/a&gt; from Furlong Solutions, for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_systems&#34;&gt;MIS&lt;/a&gt; - we have done so for several years &lt;em&gt;(indeed my understanding is that we were the second or third official school to have the system in production).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently St Mary’s Shaftesbury had a new website built (&lt;em&gt;I would like to register, that whilst I was actively involved in the project management, I did not design this website&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
