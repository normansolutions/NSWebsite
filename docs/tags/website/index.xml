      <title>Secure a webpage without a logon?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I introduced a frictionless &lt;em&gt;(logon free)&lt;/em&gt; way of providing &lt;em&gt;secure(ish)&lt;/em&gt; access to some very basic web services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the privilege of designing and building the Wylye Valley Art Trail website.  The 2015 trail consists of &lt;strong&gt;75&lt;/strong&gt; venues, and in-excess of &lt;strong&gt;300&lt;/strong&gt; artists – I’m sure you’ll agree, that’s a reasonable size!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a very good friend of mine &lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/richieclarkie&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@richieclarkie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; decided to return to the IT industry after a 15 year absence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clearly a 15 year hiatus, is significant in any industry, but especially pertaining to IT, it is arguably exceptional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most software developers at some point, will almost certainly encounter the need to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge#In_computer_science&#34;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; together a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote Wikipedia, the term &lt;strong&gt;hack&lt;/strong&gt;, for the purposes of this blog post is:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cache-busting in C# without querystrings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key benefit of working with the web &lt;em&gt;(or more specifically http)&lt;/em&gt; is it’s native ability to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html&#34;&gt;cache&lt;/a&gt;.  This can be ‘tuned’ to make websites extremely fast and slick, especially after initial page load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok…I get the whole &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbaninsight.com/2012/04/12/ten-reasons-you-should-be-using-css-preprocessor&#34;&gt;CSS pre-processor&lt;/a&gt; movement; I don’t need convincing of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is so good.  However, what I do need, is a justification to invest time into learning &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; technology!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I must confess to have slightly struggled with the title of this blog post, as I didn’t wish to be responsible for encouraging unnecessary complaints and animosity between clients and web designers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite blog posts is “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a phony. Are you?&lt;/a&gt;” by Scott Hanselman.  I was on holiday in France when I read this post, and it gave me a wonderful sense of relief - I highly encourage you to read it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt; for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment&#34;&gt;VLE&lt;/a&gt;.  I won’t give you a sales pitch on Firefly, but suffice to say, that after a bit of a journey from &lt;a href=&#34;https://moodle.org/&#34;&gt;Moodle&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint&#34;&gt;SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; we have rested at Firefly – quite simply, at this point in time &lt;em&gt;(history has taught me that things can change!),&lt;/em&gt; this product, the company and their approach to IT, is nothing short of excellent.  I like Firefly; I like the chaps and chapesses at Firefly!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently St Mary’s Shaftesbury had a new website built (&lt;em&gt;I would like to register, that whilst I was actively involved in the project management, I did not design this website&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I love IT, and web development in particular.  I also happen to be exceptionally fortunate to work as an ICT Systems Manager, for a wonderful employer (St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury) with a great boss &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pearcejim&#34;&gt;@pearcejim&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; alongside excellent, appreciative colleagues – the surrounding environment, is also quite heavenly – trust me, it beats working on an industrial estate!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To CMS or not to CMS?</title>
      <link>https://normansolutions.co.uk/to-cms-or-not-to-cms/</link>

      <guid>https://normansolutions.co.uk/to-cms-or-not-to-cms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, the time has come for a website refresh – it’s something that I like to try and do annually &lt;em&gt;(well, I say annually, what I really mean is that I did it last year).&lt;/em&gt; The question, is do I roll my own, as I have always done, or jump into the CMS world?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
