      <description>Secure access to a webpage, without the need for a logon, can often be viewed as a bit of a holy grail solution.
Recently, I introduced a frictionless (logon free) way of providing secure(ish) access to some very basic web services.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had the privilege of designing and building the Wylye Valley Art Trail website. The 2015 trail consists of 75 venues, and in-excess of 300 artists – I’m sure you’ll agree, that’s a reasonable size!</description>

      <description>A key benefit of working with the web (or more specifically http) is it’s native ability to cache. This can be ‘tuned’ to make websites extremely fast and slick, especially after initial page load.</description>

      <description>Ok…I get the whole CSS pre-processor movement; I don’t need convincing of why it is so good. However, what I do need, is a justification to invest time into learning yet another technology!</description>

      <description>One of my favourite blog posts is “I&amp;rsquo;m a phony. Are you?” by Scott Hanselman. I was on holiday in France when I read this post, and it gave me a wonderful sense of relief - I highly encourage you to read it.</description>

      <description>Recently St Mary’s Shaftesbury had a new website built (I would like to register, that whilst I was actively involved in the project management, I did not design this website).</description>

      <description>Frankly, I love IT, and web development in particular. I also happen to be exceptionally fortunate to work as an ICT Systems Manager, for a wonderful employer (St Mary&amp;rsquo;s Shaftesbury) with a great boss (@pearcejim) alongside excellent, appreciative colleagues – the surrounding environment, is also quite heavenly – trust me, it beats working on an industrial estate, just take a look!</description>
