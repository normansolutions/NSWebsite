      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I last blogged - life has certainly been busy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years I&amp;rsquo;ve somewhat immersed myself in PowerShell. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a PowerShell Guru, my knowledge has substantially grown, thanks in part to splendid collaboration with some exceptional colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having fully migrated our on-prem Exchange to Exchange Online, there were a few little gotchas along the way that we had to contend with - which was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to receive unwanted emails which have managed to work their way through the array of filtering systems in production.  Recently our organisation received such an email - a classic phishing email sent to multiple end user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Encourage those Windows to restart!</title>
      <link>https://normansolutions.co.uk/encourage-those-windows-to-restart/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common issue with supporting a primarily Windows based user body, is that thanks to the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; expectation emboldened by smartphones and tablets, it can be a constant battle to try and encourage end users to restart their computers with some degree of regularity - yes IT friends, you know exactly what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most users of Office 365 will no doubt be aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Clutter-to-sort-low-priority-messages-in-Outlook-2016-for-Windows-7b50c5db-7704-4e55-8a1b-dfc7bf1eafa0&#34;&gt;Clutter&lt;/a&gt; folder; for the most part this Clutter folder works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not intending to go into the algorithmic processes of how the Clutter folder works, in this blog post - even if I could!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It recently occurred to me, that whilst my current full-time position is an IT Systems Manager, the majority of my blog posts thus far, have been more web centric – which is great, as I love the web and web technologies!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2014, we migrated the St Mary’s Shaftesbury MIS &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_system&#34;&gt;Management Information System&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.furlongsolutions.com/&#34;&gt;Schoolbase&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isams.co.uk/&#34;&gt;iSAMS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note, that the reasons for instigating this major system change, and the processes involved &lt;em&gt;(political &amp;amp; technical),&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; covered in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a sad fact that security can all too often be the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html&#34;&gt;poor relative&lt;/a&gt; in software and systems design &lt;em&gt;(please note that this blog post is not intended to address system security per se; the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;OWASP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;website and / or security expert&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.troyhunt.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Troy Hunt’s blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;are good references for that topic).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently St Mary’s Shaftesbury had a new website built (&lt;em&gt;I would like to register, that whilst I was actively involved in the project management, I did not design this website&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
