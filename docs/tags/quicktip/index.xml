      <description>It’s been eight months since my last blog post, having taken on a new job, been on the receiving end of a full-on enterprise ransomware attack (that wasn’t nice!) and quite frankly experiencing one heck of a baptism of fire - I felt it was time do write a quick blog post tip!

On a recent episode, the company thinkst, were discussing a project they have been working on, to do with Honeypots.
 Not only are these Honeypots an extremely funky security layer, they are also free (at the time of posting).</description>
