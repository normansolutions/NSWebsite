Like many people, I've tinkered with Power BI over the years but have never really dug deep into the weeds; the same can also be said for the iSAMS REST API. So recently I thought why not combine these two systems and see what can be achieved?

It transpires a fair amount, albeit with a few initial gotchas. So I decided to write a blog post detailing the process, if nothing else to serve as a tutorial to my future self!

[Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) is the product required _(as against Power BI Online)_ - limitations in data connection options being the primary reason.
